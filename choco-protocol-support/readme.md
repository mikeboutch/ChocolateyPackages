**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original! So of course I endorse and use it. :)
* choco:// Protocol has no official support and requires special URLs that packages or websites need to add. So basically this is a proof of concept that needs to gain traction.
* This installs no software. It modifies Windows registry keys to open .nupkg files with choco-protocol-support.cmd which processing the URL and runs cinst to install the package with help by Sudo to run as admin. UAC will prompt for permission.
* This package has been tested and passed with Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. It will not work with Edge as Edge doesn't save the downloaded package file to the Downloads directory before choosing "Open."
* WARNING: Only install one package at a time until such time as Chocolatey v1.x is released. [(REFERENCE)](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1579)
* DISCLAIMER: This has NOT been tested with non-Chocolatey .nupkg files.

ROADMAP:
* Possibly configure each popular browser to automatically run .nupkg files.
